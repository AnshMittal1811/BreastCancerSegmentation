# PneumoniaDetection

Research paper depicting these results has already been accepted in MDPI Sensors Special Issue "Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging and Sensing". The URL for the paper is given in the following: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/4/1068. The model described in this paper can only distinguish between Pneumnia and Normal X-ray scans. This paper achieves an accuracy of approximately 96.36 % when detecting pneumonia from chest x-ray images using E4CC. This is done using an integration and ensemble of two deep learning algorithms, namely CNNs and Capsule networks.
